==================================

Unix
===============================================

Instructions for compiling and installing:
------------------------------------------

1. ./configure

   If you want to disable support for compressed tables you can run
   configure with the following command line argument:

   ./configure --disable-compression

   By default, support for compressed tables is enabled.

   If you want to disable support for shared libraries you can run
   configure with the following command line argument:

   ./configure --disable-shared

   By default, it will build both shared and static libraries

   The configure script attempts to select the optimal latching implementation
   for your configuration, if not explicitly set on the configure command line.
   If you need to force a particular selection you can use the following
   command line argument to select:

    --with-atomic-ops=  one of [gcc_builtins|solaris|innodb]

2. make

3. make install

4. Enjoy!

Windows
=======

HailDB does not currently build on Windows. Although there is no real reason why support could not be continued.
