Requirements
==============================================================================
ZLib 1.2.3		http://www.zlib.net
PThreads library	unix only
CMake 2.6 or above	Windows only


Build
==============================================================================
You may have to tweak the include and library paths in the Makefile.examples
file for your installation. By default it looks in "../..".

 * Unix
   It should just be a matter of running:

	make -f Makefile.examples

 * Windows
 1. cmake -G <generator-name>
   The generator could be one of the followings:
	Visual Studio 7             = Generates Visual Studio .NET 2002 project files.
	Visual Studio 7 .NET 2003   = Generates Visual Studio .NET 2003 project files
	Visual Studio 8 2005        = Generates Visual Studio .NET 2005 project files
	Visual Studio 8 2005 Win64  = Generates Visual Studio .NET 2005 Win64 project files.
	Visual Studio 9 2008        = Generates Visual Studio 9 2008 project files.
	Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64  = Generates Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64 project files

2. start Visual Studio, and open solution file TESTS.sln

3. build ALL_BUILD


Running
==============================================================================
Once the examples are built, in order to run them it should just be a matter
of invoking the binary. However, potential issues that you should be aware off
are:

  * Missing libraries
    On Unix systems: You may need to set the LD_LIBRARY_PATH e.g.,
    LD_LIBRARY_PATH=../../lib ./ib_test1

    On Windows: You may need to set the PATH e.g.,
    set PATH=%PATH%;../../lib

Important
==============================================================================
Remember to delete all data and log files before running the examples. Some
of the programs will fail on an assertion if the table already exists.
